## Customizing the Heart Character

To change the character used to draw the heart in the notebook:

1. Open `Content/Script.ipynb`.
2. Replace the character or string (`TTTT`) with any character you want to use for the heart shape and fix `[(x-y)%4]`, where `4` is the Char_Count.
3. Run the cell to see the heart drawn with your chosen character.
